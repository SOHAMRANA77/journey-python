# Taking user input for their name
a = input("Enter your name: ")

# Printing a greeting using the entered name
print("Hi,", a)

# Taking user input for two numbers and converting them to integers
x = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
y = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))

# Adding the entered numbers and printing the result
